## Notes

The Gladiar Battle-automata are lightly-armoured Cybernetica constructs designed for frontline assault and fire support. Deployed in large numbers by Mechanicum forces, they combine durable chassis with versatile weapon loadouts, allowing them to suppress enemy infantry with ranged fire or engage in close combat with powerful servo claws. Though less advanced than other automata, their reliability and ease of manufacture make them a common sight in attritional campaigns across the Age of Darkness.

Unit model might be based on UR-025, with slightly larger bases (40mm).
