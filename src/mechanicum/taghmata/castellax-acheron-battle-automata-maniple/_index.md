## Notes

Castellax Acheron Battle-automata are ancient battle constructs designed for frontline suppression and area denial. Capable of mounting heavy ranged weaponry while charging enemy lines with titanic servo-driven fists, they were commonly deployed during sieges or to counter enemy automata. Their rugged design and thick armor allow them to absorb considerable punishment, while their cortex-linked behavior ensures relentless pursuit of mission directives.

Unit model can be based on Kastelan Robots.
