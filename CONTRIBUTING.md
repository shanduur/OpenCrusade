# Contributing to OpenCrusade

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **OpenCrusade**, a community-driven collection of homebrew rules for Horus Heresy tabletop campaigns. This book is built with `mdBook` and written entirely in Markdown.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.
2. **Edit Markdown files** inside the `src/` directory following the established structure.
3. **Run `mdbook serve`** locally to preview your changes:  
   ```bash
   mdbook serve
   ```

4. **Submit a Pull Request** with a concise summary of your changes.

## Style Guidelines

* Use proper Markdown formatting.
* Use headers, lists, and tables consistently.
* Keep language concise, clear, and in-universe when applicable.
* Use British English spelling (e.g., *armour*, *honour*, *defence*).
* Stay true to the tone and lore of Warhammer: grim, archaic, militaristic.
* Follow the folder structure — don't add files to the root directory.
* One unit, faction, or rule per file. Break content into subpages if needed.

## Content Guidelines

* **Units and Characters:** Use the standard [Unit Template](./src/appendices/unit-template.md).
* **Rules:** Clearly explain how new mechanics work and how they interact with existing rules.
* **Legions/Factions:** Maintain consistency with established lore, unless writing alternate history or Blackshield content.
* **Weapon Stats:** Include a weapon profile table if introducing new wargear.

## Proposing Major Changes

For larger ideas (new mechanics, campaign systems, faction rewrites), please open [a discussion thread](https://github.com/shanduur/OpenCrusade/discussions) first to discuss with others. This avoids duplicate work and ensures cohesion.
