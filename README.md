Welcome to OpenCrusade, a community-driven ruleset and companion for exploring the brutal galaxy of the 31st Millennium. Set during the apocalyptic Horus Heresy, this document serves as a modular toolkit for players and storytellers alike - expanding narrative freedom, adding homebrew factions, and refining existing mechanics for campaigns of betrayal, loyalty, and grim warfare.

## Contributing

OpenCrusade thrives on community input. Whether you're refining rules, submitting new units, or expanding narrative content, all constructive contributions are welcome.
